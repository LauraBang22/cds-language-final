# Assignment 4 - Emotion analysis with pretrained language models

## Assignment Discription
In this assignment I have solved the following tasks:
- Predict emotion scores for all lines in the data
- For each season:
    - Plot the distribution of all emotion labels in that season
- For each emotion label:
    - Plot the relative frequency of each emotion across all seasons

## Repository Structure
In this repository you'll find three subfolders.
- In ```in``` you'll upload the data, that the code will run on.
- In ```out``` you'll find the results the code have produced.
- In ```src``` you'll find the scripts of code written to solve the tasks given in the assignment.

I have also created a ```requirements.txt``` and a ```setup.sh``` file for you to run, for the setting up a virtual environment to run the code in. And I  have created ```run.sh``` scripts to run the code from.

## Data
The data I have used in this assignment, is the scripts for all seasons of the TV show Game of Thrones, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albenft/game-of-thrones-script-all-seasons). You'll need to download the dataset and unpack it. When you unpack it you have a folder called **archive**, within that folder is a file. That is the file you need to move it to the ```in``` folder in this repository.

The model I have used in the code is the model called **emotion-english-distilroberta-base** , which you can find more information about [here](https://huggingface.co/j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base). The model can be used to classify the emotion of text.

## Reproducebility 
For this code to work, you need to be placed in the **Assignment4** folder in your terminal.

I have created a ```setup.sh``` file that can be run from the terminal using the code: 
```
bash setup.sh
``` 
When running it you create a virtual environment where you run the accompanying ```requirements.txt```.

I have for this assignment created two different ```run.sh``` files that can be run from the terminal using the code:
```
bash run_data.sh
bash run_plotting.sh
```
Each file opens the virtual environment again, then runs one of the scripts that I have written for this assignment, and finishes off by deactivating the virtual environment. 

## Results
I have for this assignment created two ```.py``` scripts. One is called ```data.py```, in which I load the dataset and run the classifier on it. I then cut the dataframe down to only containing the columns "Season" and "labels", and then save it in my **out** folder. This script can be very timeconsuming to run, which is why I decided to save the new dataframe for later use.

The other script is called ```plotting.py```. In that script I load the processed data, so I don't have to run the classifier on the data every time I open the code. Then I plot the distribution of all emotion labels in each season and the relative frequency of each emotion across all seasons. Both sets of plots can be found in the **out** folder.

From the plots over distribution of all emotion labels in each season, I can see that the distribution across the seasons are very similar. The vast majority of all lines have been deemed "neutral". The labels of "anger", "surprise" and "disgust" all have similar distribution across the seasons, but the last three labels of "fear", "sadness" and "joy" vary a little bit across the seasons.

From the plots over relative frequency of each emotion, I can see that they vary quite a lot. 
- Season 1 has the most "surprise"
- Season 3 has the most "disgust"
- Season 5 has the most "joy"
- Season 6 has the most "sadness"
- Season 7 has the most "fear"
- Season 8 has the most "anger" 

#### CodeCarbon
I have used the package ```CodeCarbon``` to measure the environmental impact of running the code in this repository. Please see Assignment 5 for the results of that.
