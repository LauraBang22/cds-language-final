# Assignment 3 - Query expansion with word embeddings

## Assignment Discription
In this assignment I have solved the following tasks for the given data:
- Loads the song lyric data
- Download/load a word embedding model via ```gensim```
- Take a given word as an input and finds the most similar words via word embeddings
- Find how many songs for a given artist feature terms from the expanded query
- Calculate the percentage of that artist's songs featuring those terms
- Print and/or save results in an easy-to-understand way
    - For example, "45% of {ARTIST}'s songs contain words related to {SEARCH TERM}"

## Repository Structure
In this repository you'll find ttwo subfolders.
- In ```in``` you'll find the data that is being used in the code.
- In ```src``` you'll find the scripts of code written to solve the tasks given in the assignment.

I have also created a ```requirements.txt``` and a ```setup.sh``` file for you to run, for the setting up a virtual environment to run the code in. And I  have created ```run.sh``` scripts to run  a possible version of the searchterms.

## Data
The data I have used in this assignment, is called **57,650 Spotify Songs**. It contains the song lyrics to 57,650 songs, and the artist who performs them. More information about the data can be found  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/57651-spotify-songs). You'll need to download the dataset and unpack it. When you unpack it you have a folder called **archive**, within that folder is a file. That is the file you need to move it to the ```in``` folder in this repository.

## Reproducebility 
For this code to work, you need to be placed in the **Assignment3** folder in your terminal.

I have created a ```setup.sh``` file that can be run from the terminal using the code: 
```
bash setup.sh
``` 
When running it you create a virtual environment where you run the accompanying ```requirements.txt```.

To run the code of the script you have to run this in the terminal: 
```
python src/Assignment3_clean.py --artist "{ARTIST}" -- "{SEARCH TERM}"
``` 
You can choose an artist and a searchterm yourself.

I have also created a ```run.sh``` file that can be run from the terminal using the code:
```
bash run_clean.sh
```
The ```run.sh``` opens the virtual environment again and contians code seaching for a specific artist and searchterm, that have been tested and works, and then deactivates the virtual environment again.

I have created two scrips for this assignment, where one of them includes running CodeCarbon on the code. For testing the code I have used the version of the script that does not include CodeCarbon, otherwise the results of the actual code can get a little lost in everything it returns regarding CodeCarbon.

Should you be interested in running the code that includes the CodeCarbon, it can be done from the terminal like this:
```
bash run_carbon.sh
```
## Results
When running this code, you'll get a percentage of songlyrics in the dataset, that contains one of the five most similar words.

Examples of code I have tested myself:
- ```python src/Assignment3.py --artist "The Beatles" --search_term "love"```
    - 69.7 % of The Beatles 's songs contain words related to love
- ```python src/Assignment3.py --artist "Lady Gaga" --search_term "power"```
    - 10.9 % of Lady Gaga 's songs contain words related to power
- ```python src/Assignment3.py --artist "Elton John" --search_term "joy"```
    - 2.9 % of Elton John 's songs contain words related to joy
 

#### CodeCarbon
I have used the package ```CodeCarbon``` to measure the environmental impact of running the code in this repository. Please see Assignment 5 for the results of that.
